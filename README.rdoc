**README**

This is a little pet project of mine. Its current primary purpose is to be a clean and organized character database for the Transformers cartoon from the 80's.

After a recent nostalgia binge I was interested in finding a quick way to find all appearances of a character by episode, as well as their first and last. This site is both a solution to this problem as well as a test bed for cleanly visualizing data for wiki-like websites.
